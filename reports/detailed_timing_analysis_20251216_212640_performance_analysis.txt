Optimization Recommendations:

  1. [HIGH] CPU Decode
     Current: 0.569 ms (16.1% of pipeline)
     Recommendation: Port CPU decode operations to GPU (estimated 2-3 weeks)
     Potential Savings: ~0.455 ms (12.9% of pipeline)
     Effort: High (2-3 weeks)
     Impact: Could reduce pipeline time by 12.9% (80% of decode time)

  2. [MEDIUM] CUDA Operations
     Current: 1.633 ms (46.3% of pipeline)
     Recommendation: Consider increasing quad_decimate (2.0 → 2.5 or 3.0) in config.txt
     Potential Savings: ~0.245 ms (estimated 15% reduction)
     Effort: Very Low (config change)
     Impact: Could reduce CUDA time by ~15%. Trade-off: Slightly reduced detection accuracy for distant tags

  3. [LOW] Filtering
     Current: 0.002 ms (0.1% of pipeline)
     Recommendation: Filtering is already highly optimized
     Potential Savings: Negligible
     Effort: N/A
     Impact: No improvement needed

Potential Performance Improvements:
  Current: 3.524 ms (283.73 FPS)
  Potential: 2.824 ms (354.11 FPS)
  Improvement: 0.700 ms (19.9% faster)
