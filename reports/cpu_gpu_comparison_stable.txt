Comparing CPU vs GPU detectors on: /home/nav/Apriltag/VPI_based/input/Stable.avi
=== DETECTION COUNT COMPARISON ===
Frames analyzed: 200
CPU total detections: 199 (avg: 0.99 per frame)
GPU total detections: 690 (avg: 3.45 per frame)
GPU after filtering: 1 (avg: 0.01 per frame)
=== FRAME-BY-FRAME COMPARISON ===
Frames with both CPU and GPU detections: 199
Frames with CPU only: 0
Frames with GPU only: 0
Frames with neither: 1
=== TAG ID DISTRIBUTION ===
CPU detector tag IDs:
  Tag ID 3: 199 detections
GPU detector tag IDs:
  Tag ID 3: 690 detections
=== PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ===
CPU average time: 5.12 ms
GPU average time: 2.74 ms
=== DETECTION LOCATION COMPARISON ===
=== DECISION MARGIN COMPARISON ===
Average margin difference (CPU - GPU): inf
Positive = CPU has higher margin, Negative = GPU has higher margin
=== KEY FINDINGS ===
⚠️  GPU detector produces significantly more detections (duplicates)
⚠️  Detection centers differ significantly (>10 pixels)
