# Quad Decimate 2.0 vs 2.5 Comparison

## Test Configuration Change

**Parameter**: `quad_decimate`  
**Before**: 2.0  
**After**: 2.5

## Expected Impact

- **Performance**: Should improve (process smaller decimated image)
- **Accuracy**: May slightly decrease (fewer pixels = less detail for distant tags)
- **Trade-off**: Speed vs. Detection Range

## Analysis

See the comparison report generated by `compare_results.py` for detailed metrics.
