=== CPU vs GPU Detector Detailed Comparison ===

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
-----------------

1. DETECTION COUNT:
   - CPU: ~1 detection per frame (CORRECT)
   - GPU: ~3-4 detections per frame (WRONG - duplicates)
   - GPU produces 3-4x more detections than CPU

2. DETECTION LOCATION (CRITICAL ISSUE):
   - Average center distance between CPU and GPU: 400-450 pixels
   - Max distance: 560-716 pixels
   - This means GPU is detecting the tag at COMPLETELY DIFFERENT locations
   - The tag is being detected in the wrong place by the GPU detector

3. PERFORMANCE:
   - CPU: ~5-7 ms per frame
   - GPU: ~2.5 ms per frame
   - GPU is 2-2.6x faster BUT produces incorrect results

4. TAG ID ACCURACY:
   - Both detect tag ID 3 (correct)
   - CPU: 1 detection per frame
   - GPU: 3-4 detections per frame (all same ID, wrong locations)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
-------------------
The GPU detector has TWO major issues:

1. DUPLICATE DETECTION BUG:
   - The reconcile_detections() function is not properly filtering duplicates
   - Multiple detection paths produce the same tag ID
   - This is a known issue in the CUDA implementation

2. WRONG DETECTION LOCATION (MORE SERIOUS):
   - The GPU detector is detecting the tag at locations 400+ pixels away
   - This suggests:
     * Incorrect coordinate transformation
     * Wrong homography calculation
     * Coordinate system mismatch
     * Possible issue with camera calibration parameters in GPU path

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------
1. Use CPU detector for accurate results (video_visualize_cpu)
2. GPU detector needs fixes for:
   - Duplicate filtering (reconcile_detections)
   - Coordinate transformation accuracy
   - Verification that camera calibration is applied correctly

The CPU detector videos (Stable_3d_cpu.avi, Moving_3d_cpu.avi) show the
correct tag location and should be used as reference.
