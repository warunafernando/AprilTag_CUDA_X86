COORDINATE FIX STATUS - Stable.avi Test Results
================================================================================

Date: Current test run

PROBLEM:
- GPU detector coordinates are in decimated space (half resolution)
- CPU detector coordinates are in full resolution
- Average center distance: 940.51 pixels (still too large)

ATTEMPTS:
1. Added coordinate scaling in DecodeTags() after reconcile_detections()
   - Always scales when quad_decimate > 1
   - Result: Distance = 940.51 pixels (double-scaling suspected)

2. Added conditional check (center < width/2 && center < height/2)
   - Result: Distance = 366.75 pixels (better but still wrong)

3. Changed check to (center < width && center < height)
   - Result: Distance = 940.51 pixels (back to double-scaling)

4. Removed check, always scale
   - Result: Distance = 940.51 pixels (double-scaling confirmed)

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
- AdjustPixelCenters() scales quad corners before quad_decode_index()
- quad_decode_index() may be using full-resolution coordinates correctly
- Our fix is scaling coordinates that are already in full resolution
- OR: quad_decode_index() always produces decimated coordinates regardless of input

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check if AdjustPixelCenters() is being called after DecodeTags()
2. Verify the actual coordinate values before and after scaling
3. Check if quad_decode_index() uses the decimated image internally
4. Consider removing the fix and fixing at the source (in quad_decode_index() or AdjustPixelCenters())

CURRENT STATUS:
- GPU detector is finding detections (9 frames with both CPU & GPU)
- Coordinate fix is in place but causing double-scaling
- Need to investigate the coordinate pipeline more carefully
