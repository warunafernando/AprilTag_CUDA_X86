=== Coordinate Transformation Fix Summary ===

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
------------------
GPU detector produces coordinates in DECIMATED SPACE (half resolution):
- GPU: (467.90, 304.48)
- CPU: (935.11, 608.39)
- GPU * 2 = (935.79, 608.96) - matches CPU within 0.7 pixels!

ROOT CAUSE:
----------
1. UpdateFitQuads() calculates corners in decimated space
2. AdjustPixelCenters() scales them to full resolution
3. RefineEdges() recalculates corners but produces decimated coordinates
4. quad_decode_index() computes homography from decimated coordinates
5. Final detection corners are wrong because homography is wrong

FIX APPLIED:
-----------
Added coordinate scaling after RefineEdges() in QuadDecodeTask():
- Scales coordinates from decimated to full resolution
- Formula: (x - 0.5) * 2 + 0.5 for quad_decimate == 2.0
- Applied before quad_decode_index() computes homography

STATUS:
------
Fix is in place but coordinates are still in decimated space.
This suggests either:
1. Fix isn't being executed (refine_edges disabled?)
2. quad_decode_index() overwrites coordinates
3. Homography computation uses wrong coordinate space

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Verify refine_edges is enabled
2. Check if quad_update_homographies() needs coordinate scaling
3. Consider disabling refine_edges as workaround
4. Add debug logging to verify fix execution
