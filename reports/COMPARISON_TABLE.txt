=== CPU vs GPU Detector Comparison Table ===

METRIC                    | CPU Detector    | GPU Detector    | Status
--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------
Detections per frame      | ~1.0            | ~3.4            | ❌ GPU has duplicates
Tag ID accuracy           | Correct (ID 3)  | Correct (ID 3)  | ✅ Both correct
Detection location        | Correct         | 400+ px offset | ❌ GPU wrong location
Processing speed          | 5-7 ms/frame    | 2.5 ms/frame   | ✅ GPU 2-2.6x faster
Duplicate filtering       | Built-in        | Broken         | ❌ GPU needs fix
Coordinate accuracy       | Accurate        | ~450px error    | ❌ GPU coordinate bug

DETAILED METRICS (200 frames):
------------------------------
Stable.avi:
- CPU detections: 199 (0.99/frame)
- GPU detections: 690 (3.45/frame) → 199 after filtering
- Center distance: 432.69 pixels average
- Max distance: 560.95 pixels

Moving.avi:
- CPU detections: 199 (0.99/frame)
- GPU detections: 758 (3.79/frame) → 199 after filtering
- Center distance: 456.17 pixels average
- Max distance: 716.88 pixels

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The GPU detector has TWO critical bugs:
1. Duplicate detection (3-4x more detections)
2. Wrong location (400+ pixel offset from correct position)

The CPU detector is accurate and should be used for correct results.
The GPU detector needs coordinate transformation fixes.
