=== AprilTag Detection Analysis Report ===

STABLE.AVI:
-----------
Total Frames: 2018
Frames with detections: 2017 (99.95%)
Frames without detections: 1 (0.05%) - Frame 0 only
Average detections per frame: 3.45
Min/Max detections per frame: 0 / 4

Tag Detection Details:
- All detections are Tag ID 3
- Multiple instances of Tag ID 3 detected per frame (3-4 detections)
- Total tag detections across all frames: 6,958
- Detection rate: Very stable, only frame 0 missed

MOVING.AVI:
----------
Total Frames: 1916
Frames with detections: 1892 (98.75%)
Frames without detections: 24 (1.25%)
Average detections per frame: 3.87
Min/Max detections per frame: 0 / 4

Tag Detection Details:
- All detections are Tag ID 3
- Multiple instances of Tag ID 3 detected per frame (2-4 detections)
- Total tag detections across all frames: 7,412
- Detection rate: Good, but some frames missed during motion
- Max consecutive frames without detection: 11 frames (around frames 1192-1200)

OBSERVATIONS:
------------
1. Both videos contain Tag ID 3, detected multiple times per frame
2. Stable.avi has near-perfect detection (99.95% frame coverage)
3. Moving.avi has good detection (98.75% frame coverage) with some misses during motion
4. The multiple detections of the same tag ID per frame suggest either:
   - Multiple physical tags with ID 3 in the scene
   - Duplicate detections of the same tag (possible false positives)
   - Different views/angles of the same tag being detected separately

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
- Consider filtering duplicate detections if only one instance of each tag ID is expected
- The detection system performs well even during motion (98.75% success rate)
- Frame 0 in Stable.avi likely missed due to initialization timing
