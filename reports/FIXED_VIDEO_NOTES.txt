=== Fixed 3D Visualization Videos ===

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
----------------
The original videos showed 3-4 detections of tag ID 3 per frame, but there is only ONE physical tag #3 in both videos.

ROOT CAUSE:
----------
The CUDA detector was producing multiple detections of the same tag ID, likely due to:
1. Multiple detection paths in the algorithm
2. Different quad candidates being decoded to the same tag ID
3. The reconcile_detections() function not fully filtering duplicates

SOLUTION:
---------
Created video_visualize_fixed tool that:
- Filters duplicate detections by tag ID
- For each tag ID, keeps only the detection with the highest decision_margin
- This ensures only ONE detection per tag ID per frame

RESULTS:
-------
Stable_3d_fixed.avi:
- Before filtering: 6958 detections (avg 3.45 per frame)
- After filtering: 2017 detections (avg 1.0 per frame)
- Now shows only ONE tag #3 per frame

Moving_3d_fixed.avi:
- Before filtering: 7412 detections (avg 3.87 per frame)
- After filtering: 1892 detections (avg 0.99 per frame)
- Now shows only ONE tag #3 per frame

The 3D axes visualization should now correctly show the pose of the single tag #3.
