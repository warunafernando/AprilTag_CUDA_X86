# Test Results Directory

This directory contains all test reports, summaries, and analysis outputs from performance testing.

## File Types

- `test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` - Raw test output files
- `*_summary.txt` - Formatted summary reports (generated by analyze_timing.py)
- `comparison_*.txt` - Side-by-side comparisons (generated by compare_results.py)
- `lost_frames_list.txt` - Frames that lost all detections (when data collection enabled)

## Usage

Test results are automatically saved here when using:
- `./test_performance.sh` - Saves test output files here
- `./analyze_timing.py` - Saves summary reports here
- `./compare_results.py` - Saves comparison reports here

The detector also saves `lost_frames_list.txt` here when data collection is enabled.
